Secure Datagram Transport Layer
===============================


The SDTL protocol is designed for establishing secure communication over UDP, utilizing elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA) for authentication and AES-GCM for encrypted data transmission. The protocol employs Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key exchange to establish a shared secret and guarantees confidentiality and data integrity using authenticated encryption.
